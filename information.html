                    <p class="infobDescription">  In EpicVerse, the resource world is typically used to address specific gameplay considerations and create a balanced and sustainable resource economy. Here are a few reasons why the resource world should be utilized:
                    </p>
                    <p class="infobContent" id="content4">

Preservation of the main world: The server often aims to recreate the real-world geography and landmarks as accurately as possible. The resource world provides a separate space where players can gather resources without altering or depleting the main world's natural terrain, structures, or resources.<br>

Sustainable resource gathering: By designating a resource world, server administrators can control and regenerate resources more effectively. It allows for the careful management of resource availability and distribution, ensuring that players have access to renewable resources and preventing the exhaustion or scarcity of valuable materials.<br>

Economic balance: The resource world can be used to establish a player-driven economy. Certain resources may be intentionally limited or more abundant in the resource world, allowing for the creation of trade networks and economic interdependencies between players and communities. This dynamic can foster cooperation, competition, and specialization among players, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.<br>

Resetting resources: Over time the main world might experience resource depletion due to extensive mining or other activities. By periodically resetting the resource world or regenerating its resources, the server can ensure a fresh supply of materials and prevent resource scarcity in the long run. This practice encourages ongoing exploration and resource gathering.<br>

Overall, the resource world serves as a controlled environment to manage resources, maintain the integrity of the main world, promote a fair and sustainable resource economy, and enhance the multiplayer experience for all players.<br>
